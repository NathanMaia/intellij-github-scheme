# IntelliJ GitHub Color Scheme

The GitHub color-scheme for IntelliJ IDEA. You can see a screenshot [here](http://orrsella.com/2013/08/12/github-color-scheme-for-intellij/). (But you don't really need to, because it's just like GitHub. Only in IntelliJ.)

## Supported Syntax / Languages

The following languages are currently supported with GitHub matching colors:

* CSS
* HTML
* Java
* JavaScript
* Scala
* XML

Please feel free to fork and send pull requests with additional languages or fixes!

## Installation

### "Automatic"

Download `settings.jar` and in IntelliJ go to `File | Import Settings...` and choose the downloaded jar.

### Manual

Download `GitHub.icls` and copy it into the `colors/` directory in the IntelliJ preferences folder. In OS X: `~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea12/colors/`.

After installation of the color scheme restart IntelliJ and then select the new scheme by going to `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts`.
